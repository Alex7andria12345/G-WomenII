With our website we included a food menu on the menu page with all the different food he makes, and also added descriptions of the food and pictures. I think our website is really good with the colors, and coordination of everything just going with everything. We also have a "Sign me up" form on the contact page just in case you forget your information to order food or trying to login in on our social media sites. We have a "Remember Me" button so when you come on our website you are already logged in to everything. One thing I mostly like about our website is on our home page we have a slideshow of all of my partner's father's different foods which are great and I honestly think will catch the veiwer's attention.   -Alex Hamlett



Making my code responsive was maybe the most difficult part for me because of the hard work going into changing the codes around and/or restructuring the whole code because one little thing could make the entire code mess up without you knowing what step you missed or made an error on. Creating the website was very enjoyable because it took me out of my comfort zone and allowed me to try something I would have never done such as coding my own website for my father. I would love to do it again after I get the proper guidence in the career field such as one-on-one with a real hands-on coder with that first hand information that could help me in the long run.   -S'mya Yarbrough
